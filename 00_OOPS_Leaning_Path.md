### **1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming** üéØ

#### What is OOP?  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses **objects** and **classes** to structure code. It allows for organizing complex programs into reusable, modular pieces.

#### Key Concepts:  
- **Objects**: Instances of a class; represent real-world entities.  
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects; define attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors).  
- **Attributes**: Variables that belong to a class or object.  
- **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class or object and define its behavior.

---

### **2. Classes and Objects** üèóÔ∏è

#### Topics: ‚ú® 
- **Defining a Class**:
  - Using the `class` keyword.  
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        pass
    ```  
- **Creating Objects** (Instances of a class):  
  ```python
  obj = MyClass()
  ```

- **Attributes**:  
  - **Instance Attributes**: Unique to each instance of a class.  
    ```python
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
    ```
  - **Class Attributes**: Shared across all instances of a class.  
    ```python
    class Dog:
        species = 'mammal'  # Class attribute
    ```

- **Accessing Attributes**:  
  - Using dot notation: `obj.attribute`.  
    ```python
    print(obj.name)
    ```

---

### **3. Methods** üõ†Ô∏è

#### Topics: ‚ú® 
- **Instance Methods**: Operate on an instance‚Äôs attributes.  
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def bark(self):
          return "Woof!"
  ```

- **Class Methods**: Operate on the class itself. Use `@classmethod`.  
  ```python
  class Dog:
      species = 'mammal'
      
      @classmethod
      def get_species(cls):
          return cls.species
  ```

- **Static Methods**: Independent of instances or the class. Use `@staticmethod`.  
  ```python
  class Math:
      @staticmethod
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b
  ```

- **Magic Methods (Dunder Methods)**:  
  Special methods surrounded by double underscores (`__`), like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`.  
  ```python
  class Point:
      def __init__(self, x, y):
          self.x = x
          self.y = y
  ```

---

### **4. Encapsulation** üîí

Encapsulation is bundling data (attributes) and methods into a single unit or class.  

#### Topics: ‚ú® 
- **Private Attributes and Methods**:  
  Denoted by a leading underscore (`_`) or double underscore (`__`).  
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.__name = name  # Private attribute
  ```

- **Getters and Setters**:  
  Safely access and modify private attributes.  
  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.__name = name
          
      def get_name(self):
          return self.__name
      
      def set_name(self, name):
          self.__name = name
  ```

- **Property Decorator**:  
  An elegant way to implement getters and setters.  
  ```python
  class Dog:
      @property
      def name(self):
          return self.__name
  ```

### **5. Inheritance** üß¨

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

#### Topics:  ‚ú®
- **Single Inheritance**:  
  A child class inherits from one parent class.  
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def speak(self):
          return "Animal sound"
  
  class Dog(Animal):
      def speak(self):
          return "Woof!"
  ```

- **Multiple Inheritance**:  
  A child class inherits from more than one parent class.  
  ```python
  class A:
      pass

  class B:
      pass

  class C(A, B):
      pass
  ```

- **`super()` Function**:  
  Used to call the parent class‚Äôs method in the child class.  
  ```python
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

  class Dog(Animal):
      def __init__(self, name, breed):
          super().__init__(name)
          self.breed = breed
  ```

### **6. Polymorphism** üé≠

Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared interfaces.

#### Topics: ‚ú® 
- **Duck Typing**:  
  Python‚Äôs dynamic typing allows flexibility.  
  ```python
  class Bird:
      def fly(self):
          return "Flying!"
          
  class Plane:
      def fly(self):
          return "Flying a plane!"
  
  def make_it_fly(obj):
      return obj.fly()
  ```

---

### **7. Abstraction** üé©

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only necessary features.  

#### Topics: ‚ú®
- **Abstract Classes**:  
  Classes that cannot be instantiated.  
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
  
  class Animal(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def speak(self):
          pass
  ```

---

### **8. Special (Magic) Methods** ü™Ñ

These methods allow the customization of how objects behave with built-in Python operators.  

#### Examples:üîç
- **`__init__()`**: Constructor called during instantiation.  
- **Operator Overloading**:  
  Define how operators (`+`, `-`) work with objects.  
  ```python
  class Point:
      def __init__(self, x, y):
          self.x = x
          self.y = y
      
      def __add__(self, other):
          return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
  ```

---

### **9. Composition vs Inheritance** üß©

#### Topics: ‚ú® 
- **Composition**:  
  A "has-a" relationship where a class contains objects of other classes.  
  ```python
  class Engine:
      def start(self):
          return "Engine started"
  
  class Car:
      def __init__(self, engine):
          self.engine = engine
      
      def start(self):
          return self.engine.start()
  ```

---

### **10. Design Patterns** üñãÔ∏è

Common patterns for better OOP practices:  
- **Singleton Pattern**: Restricts a class to a single instance.  
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class.
